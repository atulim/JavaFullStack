# Doctor Complaint Portal - JavaFX and Tesseract OCR.

Being a UI developer, I decided to ease the process of complaining about medical facilities for the people who are not fluent in English or Hindi. For the sole purpose, I designed a JavaFX application in addition to Tesseract OCR(tess4j) i.e. for text recognition, which provides comfort to the users by which they can select any type of file, be it jpeg, png, pdf and use the text in those files to fill the fields in the portal. Thus, typing is not necessary. Being a Java Developer, it is WORA(Write once Run Anywhere) application and open source. 

I am trying to add the feature of Hindi Text Recognition and Face Detection in Java. So if anyone has ideas, kindly pour it in.
